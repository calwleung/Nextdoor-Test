I’ve reached out to Friends for Life and they have agreed to list these kittens on their website! 

I really appreciate all the work fosters do and want to be as helpful as possible. Before they get to you I will get them spayed/neutered and make sure they receive:
- Rabies vaccine
- feline leukemia vaccine
- fvrcp vaccine
- ear tip
- flea medication, and 
- microchip. 
- and *maybe* some kitten food

Really trying hard to control the feral cat colony next door to me - my neighbor feeds but will not trap. I’ve TNR or rehomed 27 cats and kittens that have wandered into my lot in the last 3 years. These kittens occurred from a mom I wasn’t able to trap earlier this year.

Are you able to foster them until they can find a home through Friends for Life? You do NOT need not take them all. I’m looking to start trapping and providing medical care this week but my timing could be a little flexible if you can guarantee you can take them.
